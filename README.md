# Regression based age prediction model

This repository contains the implementation of a regression-based age prediction model.  
For this purpose, three different models are used: Random Forest, linear regression with
regularization techniques and Gradient Boosting. The models are implemented in Python and evaluated using root mean squared error (RMSE) as
the main performance metric. The repository includes all code needed for data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and comparison of the final results.
